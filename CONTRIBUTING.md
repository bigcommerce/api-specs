## Editing using Stoplight Studio

1. [Open Stoplight Studio](https://bigcommerce.stoplight.io/studio/api-reference/edit).
2. Make your edits.
3. [Make a pull request from Studio](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/studio/docs/Basics/04-common-git-tasks.md).

## Editing locally

For more complex changes, fork and edit locally.

1. Fork `bigcommerce/dev-docs`.
2. `git clone` the fork to your local machine.
3. Make edits in your favorite code editor on a new branch.
4. Commit and pushes changes to your remote repo.
5. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) against `bigcommerce/dev-docs/master`.

## Commit messages

* Always include subject; include body when necessary.
* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use imperative mood ("Fix broken link..." not "Fixes broken link...").
* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
