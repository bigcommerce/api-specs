            Optional unique identifier for this sales tax, describing the
            relevant tax classification rule on the Tax Provider platform.


            Supplying an identifier allows BigCommerce to group related taxes together from all items in the order.


            This identifier is persisted by BigCommerce and may be desirable for auditing purposes between BigCommerce and the Tax Provider. Currently supports persisting integer values only (the string type indicates we may support UUID values in the future).
          example: "1701"
      required:
        - name
        - rate
        - amount
