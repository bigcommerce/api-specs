        Creates or updates an email subscription.

        By default, customers receive abandoned cart emails as soon as they provide their email address in the checkout flow. They can opt out using this endpoint.

        However, if **Store Settings > Miscellaneous > Require Consent** is enabled, Abandoned Cart Emails are not sent by default, and the customer should opt-in.
